## Introduction

You're a marketing analyst and you've been told by the CMO that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. You need to analyze the dataset to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

## About the data

This data was downloaded from Kaggle. The author's name is Jack Daoud. He states that the data was provided for students for their final project for Dr. Omar Romero-Hernandez's class at a university to test their statistical analysis skills. Data found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data).

Since there is no other information about the data, we can infer that this data is all hypothetical and just used for practicing purposes.

### Data Overview

- 2240 customers of XYZ company (total of 2240 rows)
- 28 columns
- Each row represents customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance relative to each unique customer

### Limitations

- Using hypothetical data, so does not mimic real-life marketing campaigns

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Check for nulls and outliers. How are you going to deal with them?
- Understand the unique values in each column. Plot if necessary.
- Any general trends within the data?

## 2. Statistical Analysis

Please run statistical tests in the **form of regressions** to answer these questions and propose data-driven action recommendatins to your CMO. Make sure to interpret your results with non-statistical jargon so your CMO can understand your findings.

**Questions we'll be answering**:

- What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
- Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases? (NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS)
- Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test.
- Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do "Married PhD candidates" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish? (Hint: use your knowledge of interaction variables/effects)
- Is there a significant relationship between geographical regional and success of a campaign?

## 3. Data Visualizations in Python/Tableau

## 4. Conclusion
